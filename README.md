# Traders Hub

## Summary

A small client side web app made for a contract client who is a day trader and wanted an easy way to read and analyze his tabular data.
The app basically makes a simple ajax request to a url, and then recieves data. The magic of the app is that instead of reading raw json
data, the client wanted it neatly formatted and converted to easy to read formats. So instead of seeing long strings and irrelevant numbers
the client now sees technical terms he recognizes and that makes it easier for him to decide which stocks to focus on. 

He is now a happy camper.
